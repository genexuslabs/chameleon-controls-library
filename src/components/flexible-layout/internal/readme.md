# Flexible Layout control internal implementation

The following folder contains internal definitions and Web Components used by the render of the flexible-layout control (`ch-flexible-layout-render`). We encourage you to avoid reading the Web Components readme file in the "internal" folder, as the only readme file needed to understand and use the control is located in the previous folder.
